      <description>It is Christmas time and as usual all of us are busy in shopping. Usually I buy stuff from internet ecommerce sites, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t these days, right? For shoppers, ecommerce site provides the experience of single destination. They type www.myfavshoppingsite.com and they purchase the stuff and it&amp;rsquo;s all usual business.
However, as an engineer, we understand that it is not easy to keep those sites functioning and business as normal for the shoppers.</description>

      <description>My name is Lalit Kale. I am software engineer and hands on software architect (not the diagraming one or not the ivory tower one) working in Dublin, Ireland.
I love working on large-scale distributed systems and fortunate to have worked with some of them at Synechron, Dell and VerizonConnect.
If you’re working on an interesting technology-related problem, I’d love to hear from you: you can reach me at lalitkale at gmail dot com</description>
